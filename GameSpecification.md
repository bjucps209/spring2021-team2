Insert Player Image

The enemy of the player rides a buzzard. The buzzards move randomly around the map defaulting at a hover above the platforms.

Insert Opponent Image

When a buzzard is defeated, the enemy riding will turn into an egg and fall onto a platform. Eggs can be collected for points. After a while if an egg is never collected, an enemy will hatch from the egg and a buzzard will come and pick him up.

Insert Opponent Image

Pterodactyls spawn when the player has taken too long to defeat all the buzzards in a wave. They are able to thrust themselves at the player when close and are difficult to destroy.

Insert Opponent Image

Platforms are placed throughout the map in the sky. A default platform will always be present in the bottom center of the map. Some platforms have respawn points that will bring back the fallen player or bring new buzzards.

## Art Style

The art style is based off of the Joust arcade game from 1982. The 2D sprites were recreated based off of the sprites from the 1982 Joust game. Animations will be given to the player, buzzards, and pterodactyls.

## Story

Welcome to Ocean Brawl. You are a small fish who is determined to rule the ocean. Fight bigger fish on your way to ultimate victory.   



## Gameplay

In Joust, you control an ostrich mounted by a knight holding a lance. The goal is to survive waves of enemies and earn as many points as possible by defeating all enemies. You defeat an enemy when your lance is higher than your opponent's lance when you collide with that enemy. However, if your lance is beneath your opponent's lance, you will be defeated.

## Player Lives

Players start with three lives. When a player is defeated, that player will lose one life and re-spawn at a random spawn platform.

## Level Design

Each level will contain a base platform at the bottom of the screen. On either side of the base platform is a lava pit that consumes any bird or egg it touches. There will be several smaller platforms above the base platform. The base platform and about half of the other platforms will be spawn platforms. Birds can land on the platforms and walk on them.

## Player Death

When a buzzard dies, it will drop an egg from its last location with its last speed and direction. If the egg hits a platform it will lose all momentum and remain stationary. If a player touches an egg, he will collect it for points. If the egg is not collected within ten seconds, it will hatch into a new rider. A new buzzard will spawn from a spawn platform and fly to the rider. The rider will mount the buzzard and the player will have to defeat it again.

Single Player

In single player mode, the game will run on the local computer (Internet connectivity is not required for single player).

Heads Up Display

The HUD (Heads Up Display) will be shown on the base platform for each player. It will show the players current score and number of lives.

## Game Controls

Each ostrich can move left, right, and up. Due to gravity, the ostrich will have a downward force and will move down if not moving up by input. The max velocity of the ostrich up and down is 275 pixels per second. The wing flap lasts 0.1 seconds allowing the player to quickly change a downwards velocity to an upwards velocity. A single wing flap will increase the ostrich's upward acceleration by 1375 pixels per second squared for the duration of the wing flap.

Left - Pressing the A or left arrow key
Right - Pressing the D or right arrow key
Up - Pressing the W or up arrow key
Down - Gravity
Scoring

The points are obtained by collecting eggs, killing a buzzard, or killing a pterodactyl. The score will display at the bottom of the screen.

Eggs - 250 points
Buzzard - 500 points
Pterodactyl - 1000 points
A player's total points can be found with this formula: (eggsCollected * 250) + (buzzardsMurdered * 500) + (pterodactylsMassacred * 1000)

Level Progression

Joust progressively gets harder as the player completes more waves. A wave is made more difficult by changing the amount of buzzards that spawn in that wave. More pterodactyls will also spawn as the player progresses. The player starts at wave 0 (unless they select another difficulty) and progresses to wave 99. Upon completing wave 99, the player will be sent back to wave 0.

Title Screen

The first screen seen by players when they load the game will be the title screen. The title screen will have five buttons. The first button will take the player to the single player screen. The second will display the help screen. The third button will show the about screen. The fourth button will go to the high score screen. The fifth button will go to the level designer.
