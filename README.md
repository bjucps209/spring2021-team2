## Instructions

To play the game, you may use either your mouse or the W, A, S, D to control the moving direction. Navigate across the ocean and try to avoid the opnonents as they will look to eat you. Do your best to become the biggest fish in the ocean. If you are the biggest fish, you will move on to the next level.

## Work Completed

* Blake Alexander - Model code finished for High Scores. FXML started and view code in progress. A txt is able to be created but the View does not read from the txt file to insert the high scores yet.
* Patrick Menking - Basic serialization completed, still needs implementation in the GUI along with testing.
* Shubin Yuan - user object can do basic movement and action. Other fish will updata position, random speed and direction, and user fish eating.
* Gunnar Funderburk- Model Code, FXML in the middle of development, some bugs with saving and loading still under work but mostly complete.
